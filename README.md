# finis

Finis is a demonstration of a discrete [Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine)
[finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) running on a
AVR microcontroller.

## Hardware Layout

For this demonstration I am using a simple layout with an ATmega328P microcontroller
some LEDs, NPN Transistors and a Photoresistor. The ATmega uses an external
Crystal with 16 MHz clock rate. Our application shows the brightness detected by
the photoresistor with different colored LEDs. We need four of them (red, green,
yellow, blue). I use NPN transistors to drive the LEDs. The following schematic
should help you to rebuild my layout.

## State Machine

I have written a Table-Driven State Machine in C. This State Machine has 3 main
states and 3 transitional states. The input is derived from the value read by the ADC.
Connected to the ADC is a photoresistor. The ambient light conditions are divided in
three ranges.

Here is the state machine definition table

| State     | Input Bright | Input Dim | Input Dark |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| GREEN     | GREEN        | TO_RED    | TO_YELLOW  |
| RED       | TO_GREEN     | RED       | TO_YELLOW  |
| YELLOW    | TO_GREEN     | TO_RED    | YELLOW     |
| TO_GREEN  | GREEN        | GREEN     | GREEN      |
| TO_RED    | RED          | RED       | RED        |
| TO_YELLOW | YELLOW       | YELLOW    | YELLOW     |

The neat thing about using a table is this can be translated directly into code.
Have a look at the `struct s_type` and the global arrays FSM in `finis.c`

This implementation currently uses `_delay_ms()` to control the FSM tick frequency.
Depending on what your application does it might be better to use a Timer register.
